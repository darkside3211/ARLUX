 ## About The Project

We are developing an e-commerce application that aims to enhance the online shopping experience of users through the use of Augmented Reality and 3d interactive models that can potentially increase sales and customer satisfaction in Jewelry Stores.
 ### Built With

This project was built with the following technologies:


- [Vue](https://vuejs.org)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- [Snap AR Lens Studio](https://ar.snap.com/lens-studio)
- [Snap AR CameraKit](https://ar.snap.com/camera-kit)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
- [Express JS](https://expressjs.com)
- [Three JS](https://threejs.org)
 ## Usage

This project will be deployed on Android, iOS, and Web. 

Users can try different jewelry items from Rings, Bracelets, Necklaces, and Earrings using the embedded technology of Snap AR.

Also, they can inspect the jewelry product using a 3D inspection feature powered by Three JS.

The first Early Adopter of this application will be used by the Jewelry Store chosen by the researchers.

This project serves as a Partial Fulfilment of the Requirements for the Degree Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
